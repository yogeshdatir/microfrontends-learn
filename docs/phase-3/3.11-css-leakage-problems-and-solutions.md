# CSS Leakage: Problems and Solutions in Micro-Frontends

## What is CSS Leakage?

CSS leakage occurs when styles from one micro-frontend (MFE) unintentionally affect another, or the host application. This breaks isolation and can cause visual bugs.

## Common Causes

- Global CSS selectors (e.g., `body`, `.btn`)
- Imported base styles or resets
- Shared class names across MFEs
- Third-party libraries injecting global styles

## Real-World Example

If both host and remote use `.header { color: red; }`, the style may override each other, leading to unpredictable results.

## Solutions

### 1. Scoped Styling

- **CSS Modules**: Generates unique class names per component.
- **BEM**: Naming convention to avoid collisions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first, avoids global selectors.

### 2. Shadow DOM

Encapsulates styles at the component level (advanced, optional).

### 3. Namespacing

Prefix class names per MFE (e.g., `.mfe1-header`).

### 4. Avoid Global Imports

Import only required styles in each MFE.

### 5. Tooling

Both Vite and Webpack support CSS Modules and scoped CSS. See respective folders for setup details.
