| **Technical Debt**         | Maintenance becomes difficult   | Regular architecture reviews    |

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Questions to Ask

1. **Team Size**: Do you have more than 8 developers?
2. **Domain Complexity**: Are there distinct business domains?
3. **Technology Needs**: Do teams need different tech stacks?
4. **Deployment Frequency**: Do features need independent releases? Consider both production frequency and development velocity.
5. **Organizational Structure**: Are teams organized by product areas?
6. **Risk Tolerance**: Can you handle increased complexity?

### 🚀 Deployment Frequency Considerations

**Production Deployments**: How often do you want to ship to users?
**Development Velocity**: How often do teams merge to main branch?
**Multiplication Effect**: With many teams, even "low" individual frequency becomes high aggregate frequency

**Example**: 10 teams × weekly releases = 10 deployments/week coordination overhead

### Decision Matrix

**Scoring**: Rate each factor 1-10 for both architectures (10 = perfect fit)

| Factor                | Weight | Scoring Guide                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Team Size**         | 25%    | Small (2-8): Monolith=8, MFE=3<br/>Large (20+): Monolith=3, MFE=8 |
| **Domain Complexity** | 20%    | Single domain: Monolith=8, MFE=4<br/>Multiple domains: Monolith=4, MFE=8 |
| **Technology Diversity** | 15% | Same tech: Monolith=8, MFE=4<br/>Different tools needed: Monolith=3, MFE=9 |
| **Deployment Frequency** | 20% | Monthly to prod: Monolith=7, MFE=5<br/>Daily to prod or high dev velocity: Monolith=3, MFE=9 |
| **Organizational Fit** | 20%   | Single team: Monolith=9, MFE=3<br/>Teams by domain: Monolith=4, MFE=8 |

**Calculation**: (Score × Weight) for each factor, sum totals
**Result**: Choose the architecture with the higher weighted score.

## 🎯 Summary

### Choose MFE When:
- Large, distributed teams (8+ developers)
- Multiple distinct business domains
- Need for technology diversity
- Independent deployment requirements
- Organizational structure supports autonomy

### Choose Monolith When:
- Small, cohesive teams (< 8 developers)
- Simple or tightly coupled application
- Startup/MVP phase requiring speed
- Limited resources or expertise
- Consistent UX is critical

## 🔄 Next Steps

After understanding the trade-offs:

1. **Assess Your Context**: Use the decision framework
2. **Start Small**: If choosing MFE, begin with a pilot
3. **Plan Migration**: Develop a gradual migration strategy
4. **Invest in Tooling**: Set up proper monitoring and CI/CD
5. **Train Teams**: Ensure teams understand the new paradigms
