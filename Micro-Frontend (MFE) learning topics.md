Here’s a clear, hands-on **Micro-Frontend (MFE) learning topic list in order**, structured for gradual progression with PR-based work:

---

## 🧱 Phase 1: Fundamentals

1. **What is Micro-Frontend Architecture?**
2. **Why MFE over monolith? (pros, cons, use cases)**
3. **Module Federation: Core Concepts**
4. **Host vs Remote: How They Communicate**
5. **Setting Up a Basic Host and Remote (Webpack 5 or Vite MF plugin)**

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Integration Mechanics

6. **Exposing & Consuming Components**
7. **React.lazy + Suspense with Remote Modules**
8. **Mounting Remote Apps into Host DOM**
9. **Dynamic Imports vs Static Imports**
10. **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting in MFEs**

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: Styling and Isolation

11. **CSS Leakage: Problems and Solutions**
12. **Using CSS Modules / BEM / Tailwind for Scoped Styling**
13. **Handling Shared Fonts, Variables, Base Styles**
14. **Shadow DOM (optional/advanced)**

---

## 🏗️ Phase 4: Shared Logic and Utilities

15. **Sharing Design Systems Across MFEs**
16. **Utility Sharing (dateFns, lodash, etc.)**
17. **Versioning Shared Libraries**
18. **Singletons and `shared` config in Module Federation**

---

## 🌐 Phase 5: Environment and Deployment

19. **Environment-based Remote Loading (dev, staging, prod)**
20. **Hosting Builds on Apache/Nginx/S3/CDN**
21. **RemoteEntry URLs & PublicPath Config**
22. **CI/CD Considerations for Individual MFEs**
23. **Managing URLs Without a Shell App**

---

## ⚙️ Phase 6: Advanced Integration

24. **Inter-MFE Communication Patterns**
25. **Global State Sharing (event bus, Zustand, custom context)**
26. **Error Boundaries for Isolated Crashes**
27. **Fallback Strategies When Remote Fails**

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: Scaling Up

28. **Routing Across MFEs (with or without Shell App)**
29. **Auth Integration in MFEs**
30. **Mixing Frameworks (React + Vue)**
31. **Lazy Loading MFEs Based on Route or Permission**
32. **Migrating from Monolith to MFE Gradually**

---

## 🧪 Bonus / Optional

33. **Performance Monitoring in MFE Context**
34. **Security Concerns (Sandboxing, CSP)**
35. **Using Web Components as MFEs**
36. **Micro-Frontends with Vite + vite-plugin-federation**
37. **Using Static HTML (e.g., Smarty, Blade) as the Shell**

## ✅ Benefits

| Reason                   | Why it works                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🔁 Side-by-side learning | You can compare Vite vs Webpack in real time    |
| ✅ Clear separation       | No confusion about tooling or config            |
| 📦 Reusable structure    | Each dir can have its own package.json, scripts |
| 🚀 Easy to extract later | Turn one or both into real apps if needed       |
