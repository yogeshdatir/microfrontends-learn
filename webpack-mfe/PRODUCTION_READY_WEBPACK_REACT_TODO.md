# Production-Ready Webpack React App Setup Guide

## 🚀 Initial Setup Steps

- [x] Create project directory and initialize yarn
- [x] Install React and React DOM dependencies
- [x] Install TypeScript and type definitions
- [x] Install webpack and webpack-cli
- [x] Install webpack-dev-server for development
- [x] Install ts-loader for TypeScript compilation
- [x] Install html-webpack-plugin for HTML generation
- [x] Create basic project structure (src/, public/)
- [x] Create webpack.config.js with basic configuration
- [x] Create tsconfig.json with TypeScript configuration
- [x] Add scripts to package.json (start, build, serve)
- [x] Create index.html template
- [x] Create basic React components (App.tsx, index.tsx)
- [x] Test basic setup with development server

## 🚀 Priority 1: Core Webpack Configuration

- [x] Add CSS loaders (css-loader, style-loader)
- [ ] Add SASS/SCSS, LESS, postcss loaders ( sass-loader, less-loader, postcss-loader) (optional - if using those extensions)
- [ ] Add image loaders (file-loader or url-loader) (webpack < 5)
- [ ] Add SVG loaders (svg-url-loader or @svgr/webpack) (webpack < 5)
- [ ] Add font loaders for custom fonts (webpack < 5)
- [x] Add asset handling rules for images, fonts, etc. (webpack 5 asset modules)
- [ ] Configure asset optimization and compression (optional - for advanced optimization)

## 🔧 Priority 2: Development Experience

- [x] Set up Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- [ ] Configure source maps for debugging (NEEDS RESEARCH - complex behavior with webpack-dev-server, React, TypeScript)
- [x] Add development server configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables handling (.env files)
- [x] Add build progress indicators (--progress flag, plugins)

## ⚡ Priority 3: Production Optimization

- [ ] Configure production mode optimizations
- [ ] Set up code splitting and lazy loading (code-level: React.lazy, dynamic imports)
- [ ] Add tree shaking configuration
- [ ] Configure minification (Terser plugin)
- [ ] Set up bundle analysis tools
- [ ] Configure splitChunks optimization in webpack.config.js (optional)

## 🛠️ Priority 4: Build & Deployment

- [ ] Add clean build directory functionality
- [ ] Configure public path for different environments
- [ ] Set up TypeScript declaration file generation
- [ ] Add build size optimization
- [ ] Configure asset caching strategies

## 🧪 Priority 5: Testing & Quality

- [ ] Add TypeScript type checking during build
- [ ] Set up linting configuration (ESLint)
- [ ] Add code formatting (Prettier)
- [ ] Configure testing setup (Jest/React Testing Library)
- [ ] Add build validation scripts

## 📋 Priority 6: Documentation & Maintenance

- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document build and deployment process
- [ ] Add build and deployment scripts
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Set up version management

## 🔍 Research Tasks

- [ ] Research React performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Look into bundle size analysis tools
- [ ] Investigate React error boundary patterns
- [ ] Research deployment strategies for React apps
- [ ] Study React best practices for production

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Create project directory
mkdir my-react-app && cd my-react-app

# 2. Initialize package.json
yarn init -y

# 3. Install core dependencies
yarn add react react-dom
yarn add -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
yarn add -D ts-loader html-webpack-plugin

# 4. Create project structure
mkdir src public
touch src/index.tsx src/App.tsx
touch webpack.config.js tsconfig.json
touch public/index.html

# 5. Add scripts to package.json
# Edit package.json and add:
# "scripts": {
#   "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open",
#   "build": "webpack --mode production",
#   "serve": "serve dist"
# }
```

### Key Configuration Files

- **webpack.config.js**: Bundle configuration
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript compiler options
- **package.json**: Dependencies and scripts
- **public/index.html**: HTML template

### Testing Your Setup

```bash
yarn start  # Start development server
yarn build  # Build for production
```

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on making a solid, production-ready React app first
- Each priority builds on the previous one
- Test thoroughly after each major change
- Keep MFE considerations for later

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] App builds and runs in production mode
- [ ] Assets load correctly (CSS, images, fonts)
- [ ] Build process is optimized and fast
- [ ] Development experience is smooth with HMR
- [ ] Production build is optimized and secure
- [ ] Code quality tools are in place
- [ ] Testing setup is configured
